                          #  RAG Chatbot with Streaming Responses ‚Äì Legal Document QA

An AI-powered chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on custom documents (e.g., legal terms, privacy policy). Uses FAISS for semantic retrieval and Mistral-7B-Instruct (GGUF) running locally via LM Studio, with real-time streaming responses in a Streamlit interface.

This is an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers user queries using a legal PDF document (e.g., Terms & Conditions). It uses local embeddings for retrieval and runs a fine-tuned LLM (**Mistral-7B-Instruct**) via **LM Studio** for generation. The chatbot supports **token-by-token streaming** in a friendly **Streamlit UI**.

##  How to Run the Project

###  1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd rag-chatbot
```

---

###  2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

---

###  3. Install Requirements

Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:

```txt
streamlit
faiss-cpu
PyMuPDF
spacy
sentence-transformers
requests
```

Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

---

###  4. Preprocess PDF ‚Üí Chunks

Place your PDF in the `data/` folder as `document.pdf`.

Then run:

```bash
python src/chunker.py
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Create Embeddings + FAISS Index

```bash
python src/embedder.py
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Run the Mistral Model (Locally)

- Download [Mistral-7B-Instruct GGUF Q4_K_M](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF)
- Load it into [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
- Go to **Chat tab** ‚Üí Select model ‚Üí ‚úÖ Enable API Server
- It should say:  
  `API Server running at http://localhost:1234`

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Launch the Streamlit Chat App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8501`
