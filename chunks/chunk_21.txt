You authorize us to use automated tools to translate your eBay content, including member-to- member communications, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed. One of the ways we make eBay.com listings available to international buyers is through the eBay International Shipping Program ("EIS"). EIS enables buyers to obtain parcel processing, international shipping, and customs clearance services. It is facilitated by eBay through third-party service providers that eBay has contracted with to operationalize the program. By listing your item on eBay.com you agree to the EIS Terms and Conditions. If you choose not to participate in EIS, you can opt out of the program by updating your shipping preferences. 10. Content
